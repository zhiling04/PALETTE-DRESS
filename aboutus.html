            <h1>Company&#10076;s Background</h1>
            <p>In the year 2024, Syaf, Kai Yi, Yulu, and Wan Xuan came together to establish Palette. 
            The inception of the company can be traced back to their first semester at Kolej Matrikulasi when 
            they embarked on a video resume assignment for their Pengajian Am course. Little did they know that
            this assignment would spark the inspiration for a venture that would address a common challenge faced 
            by themselves and their peers. As they delved into the world of video production, the founders encountered 
            a significant hurdle - the struggle to find suitable clothing for their shoots. This dilemma was not unique 
            to them; it resonated with many of their peers who faced similar issues when trying to source appropriate 
            attire for various occasions. The result was a collective effort to borrow clothes from friends and 
            roommates, highlighting the lack of accessible and convenient options for acquiring suitable clothing. 
            Recognizing the widespread nature of this challenge, Syaf, Kai Yi, Yulu, and Wan Xuan saw an opportunity 
            to create a solution. This shared experience became the driving force behind the establishment of Palette. 
            The company's mission became clear: to provide a platform where individuals could easily access a diverse 
            range of clothing options for various occasions, eliminating the need to borrow from others or compromise 
            on their personal style (Priem., et al, 2013).</p>
